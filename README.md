I achieved the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification on Mar 22, 2025 at age 13 after preparing for  just about a month, mostly via practical labs and practice questions.

> *"Earners of this certification have a comprehensive understanding of AWS services and technologies. They demonstrated the ability to build secure and robust solutions using architectural design principles based on customer requirements. Badge owners are able to strategically design well-architected distributed systems that are scalable, resilient, efficient, and fault-tolerant."*

The exam broadly featured the AWS Compute, Storage and Database set of services, asking questions about EC2, S3, RDS, Aurora, and more. However the whole exam was not focused on just one suite of services.
