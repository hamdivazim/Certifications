I achieved the AWS Developer Associate certification on Feb 21, 2025 at age 13 after preparing mostly via practical labs and practice questions.

> *"Earners of this certification have a comprehensive understanding of application life-cycle management. They demonstrated proficiency in writing applications with AWS service APIs, AWS CLI, and SDKs; using containers; and deploying with a CI/CD pipeline. Badge owners are able to develop, deploy, and debug cloud-based applications that follow AWS best practices."*

The exam mostly featured the AWS Serverless suite of services, which includes Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito and more.
